# Smart_sotring-Identifying-fresh-and-rotten-fruits-and-vegetables

# Project Overview

Smart Sorting is a deep learning–based web application that identifies whether a fruit or vegetable is fresh or rotten from an uploaded image.

The model was trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and deployed through a Flask web application for real-time predictions.

This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with web development for practical quality inspection.

# Model Training Environment (Google Colab)

The model was trained using Google Colab.

Libraries used during training:

TensorFlow / Keras – Model building and training

NumPy – Numerical operations

Pandas – Dataset handling

Matplotlib – Accuracy and loss visualization

Scikit-learn – Data splitting and evaluation metrics

# Application Development Environment (VS Code)

The trained model (.h5 file) was integrated into a Flask web application and developed locally using VS Code.

Libraries required to run the web application:

Flask – Backend framework

TensorFlow – Load and run the trained model

NumPy – Image array processing

Pillow – Image handling

OpenCV – Image preprocessing

Python-dotenv – Environment variable management

All required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file.

# Dataset Information
